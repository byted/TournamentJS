#TournamentJS

Track your round-robin tournaments with this small in-browser app. This app was developed several years ago when experimenting with JavaScript.

Minified with [inliner](https://github.com/remy/inliner)

**Pros**
* plattform independent - runs in the browser
* only a single HTML file
* no external dependencies: no JQuery, no nothing
* runs offline

**Cons**
* code is old and pretty ugly
